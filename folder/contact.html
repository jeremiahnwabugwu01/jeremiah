20 Practical Beginner CSS Tasks (No Flexbox/Grid Yet)
BLOG SECTION TASKS

Blog Card Styling (Basics)
Create three blog post cards with a title, author name, and date. Add padding, borders, and background color to make each card distinct.

Hover Effect on Blog Title
Make each blog title change color when hovered.

Add Blog Excerpts
Style a short paragraph under each title with smaller text and lighter color for readability.

Date Tag Styling
Display the blog date inside a small colored box with rounded corners beside the title.

Read More Link Styling
Add a “Read More” link at the bottom of each blog and make it look like a button (using border, padding, color).

Blog Image Styling
Add an image at the top of each blog card and round the corners slightly.

Shadow Effect on Blog Card
Add a subtle box-shadow to each card to make it appear lifted from the background.

Active Blog Highlight
Style one specific blog card differently (using an ID selector) to look like a featured post (e.g., different background color).

Author Section
Create a small “Author:” text below each blog. Style the author’s name in bold and color it differently.

Blog Container Spacing
Add consistent spacing (margin and padding) between multiple blog cards to make them visually separate.

PRODUCT CARD TASKS

Basic Product Card Styling
Create 3 products with image, name, and price. Give each card a border, background color, and rounded edges.

Price Tag Styling
Style the price in a larger, bolder font and color it green to show it’s important.

Discount Badge
Add a small “20% OFF” badge at the top-right corner of a product using position: relative/absolute (light introduction to positioning).

Product Description
Add a small paragraph under each product name and use font-size and color to create visual hierarchy.

Add to Cart Button Styling
Add a button at the bottom of each product card. Use padding, background-color, border-radius, and hover effect to make it stand out.

Product Image Border
Give the product image a thin border and rounded corners.

Sale Product Highlight
Use an inline style or special class to make sale products appear with a colored background.

Card Spacing Practice
Add equal margins between product cards and ensure there’s breathing space around text inside the cards.

Category Label Styling
Add a small label like “Electronics”, “Fashion”, or “Beauty” above each product name, styled with a background and white text.
Card Hover Lift
When hovering over a product card, slightly increase its box-shadow and make it appear lifted.
